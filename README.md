## Logic Gate Simulation
The result is done by a neural network(without DL framework).

## MNIST by Keras
Keras examples
This contains two examples: 
* MNIST
* Fashion MNIST

## The Custom loss function of Keras
The two loss function codes (mean_absolute_percentage_error, mean_squared_error) are actually applied to the internal framework.
I put the code in the custom "def function" and show the calling process(mean_squared_error) with MNIST.

## Titanic Survival Prediction
The training data has been pre-processed. 
This example lets you pick some features and build a simple DNN model to predict survival.

<p>
I have prepared two subsets and used to show the results.
*   Group 1

    > Duane, Mr. Frank
    > Svensson, Mr. Johan
    > Turkula, Mrs. (Hedwig)
    > Herman, Miss. Alice
    > Braund, Mr. Owen Harris
    

*   Group 2

    > Guggenheim, Mr. Benjamin
    > Byles, Rev. Thomas Roussel Davids
    >ã€€Rosalie Ida Blun
    > Lines, Miss. Mary Conover
    > Blank, Mr. Henry
